# Zigzag-Serpent
 Zigzag Serpent is a classic Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project offers a nostalgic gaming experience, where players control a snake to collect food items and grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. The game progressively increases in difficulty as the snake grows longer, challenging players to maneuver strategically.
